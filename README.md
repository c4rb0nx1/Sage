# Sage :) Your personal CLI companion</p>

#### Sage is a CLI assistant influenced by GitHub's Copilot (powered by GPT-4) whereas sage offers broad compatibility with various LLMs either via API or by running them locally, courtesy of Crew AI. It provides the flexibility to easily adjust outputs. The commands and descriptions generated by Sage rely entirely on the chosen LLMs. It's advisable to consider the performance benchmarks of different LLMs to select the most suitable one for your needs.
